    <p1> So after I graduated from college ,I knew that i wanted to get onto the development front so i worked as an intern for a start-up in Goa<br>
         for a period of 6 months,but having had some amount of experience over a small project back in college I remembered ohw much i enjoyed<br>
         building a website so after much consideration and thinking I finally gave web development a go and decided I'm gonna learn all about it<br>
         and I'm currently learning the same from edwisor.com,I plan on taking up projects in the future in both web and mobile development <br>
         I also do have a keen interest in IOT so i'll definitely want to get on that front as well</p1>
